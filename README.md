#Super Mario World Review

This is a rather detailed review of Super Mario World for the Super Nintendo. The review features 47 videos, interactive components, and lots of information on the game. It was an experiment and a way to get some more ClojureScript and [Om](https://github.com/swannodette/om) under my belt.

##cropping-app
This directory contains an Atom Shell based app (named Daisy) that manipulates Super Nintendo videos. Daisy is how I made all of the videos for the review. It's a very raw, very alpha app that likely will never get much beyond that. It requires ffmpeg and ImageMagick. They are used to export the raw videos to mp4, webm and animated gif.

This directory contains the actual review. The review will (very) soon be hosted on [my blog](http://www.mattgreer.org)
